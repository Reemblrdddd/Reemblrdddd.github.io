            <h1> History Pancakes</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 16px;">Pancakes are a globally beloved and historically significant dish, with a history spanning back thousands of years. The earliest version, dating possibly to the Stone Age, was a simple mixture of ground plants and water cooked on a hot rock. The first recorded mention of a pancake-like food comes from Ancient Greece around 600 B.C.. The Greeks called their version tēganitēs (or tiganites), a name derived from the word for "frying pan". These were made with wheat flour, olive oil, honey, and curdled milk, and topped with additional honey, sesame seeds, or cheese. Pancakes have remained popular throughout history due to their simple ingredients and ease of preparation. This inherent versatility has allowed for countless regional adaptations; almost every culture has its own version, from the thin French crêpe and the Eastern European blini to the thick, fluffy American style. This rich history and adaptability secure the pancake's place as a truly enduring and classic food.<p>Source:<a href="https://youtu.be/NCMKedZvnyI?si=yuxTXA_tBT4SU9eW" target="_blank">Smithsonian magazine</a></p>
